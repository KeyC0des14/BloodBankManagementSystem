# BloodBankManagementSystem

This Application is build using C# (C-Sharp) Programming Language  and MS SQL Server Database.

I began using aThree-Tier Architecture of Software Development:
i.e. 
1. User Interface (UI)
2. Business Logic Layer (BLL)
3. Data Access Layer (DAL)

And Relational Database is used as the primary database design for this application.
